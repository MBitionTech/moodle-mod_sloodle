<h4>Stipend Giver</h4>
<p>
 This is a sub-type of the SLOODLE module, allowing you to setup a means to pay a certain amount of Linden Dollars to your students in OpenSimulator.
 In order to make the transfer, you will need to setup a SLOODLE Stipend Giver object in OpenSimulator as well, and connect it to your Stipend Giver in Moodle.
 Students can then click the object in OpenSimulator to receive their payment.
